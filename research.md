I am primarily interested in Systems Security and how it influences other fields. I am currently exploring the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) security and helping develop a framework to detect vulnerabilities in generic IoT devices.

## Publications

## Other Research 

During my Masters I worked on detection of malicous OOXML documents using domain specific features. You can find my thesis right [<span style="color: #6495ED ">here</span>](assets/files/Thesis2017IS17.pdf) and the corresponding presentation [<span style="color: #6495ED ">here</span>](assets/files/Presentation2017IS17.pdf).

## Peer Review

I have been on occasion asked to review articles for [Journal of Computer Security by IOS Press](https://www.iospress.com/catalog/journals/journal-of-computer-security).
