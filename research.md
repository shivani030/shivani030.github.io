I am primarily interested in the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and Information Security, with a focus on influence the fields have on each other. I am currently exploring the use of machine learning against stream cyphers. The pre-print of the paper should be up soon. Also, my article based on my master's dissertation titled, "Detection of Malicious OOXML Documents Using Domain-Specific Features", should be available soon.
