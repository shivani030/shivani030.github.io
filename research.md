I am primarily interested in the intersection between Information Security with a focus on influence into other fields. I am currently exploring the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) with focus on a framework to detect vulnerabilities in generic IoT devices. I have been on occasion asked to review articles for "Journal of Computer Security" by IOS Press.
