I graduated at the top of my class from Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Gwalior, India with my Master's (M.Tech) in infomration security in May 2019. I wrote my theis on Detection of Malicious OOXML Documents Using Domain Specific Features under the supervision of Prof Shashikala Tapaswi. 


I was born in Nagpur, India, and was moved down to Bangalore by my parents when I was two months old. After spending eighteen years of my life there, I  moved west to attend school at [<span style="color: #d16952">Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal</span>](https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/department-list/computer-science-and-engineering.html){:target="_blank"}. Thereafter, I spent a year at Xerox Research Center, India before moving out far west to [<span style="color: #e6ce20">University of California, Santa Cruz</span>](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering){:target="_blank"} where I graduated with an MS in Computer Science.
