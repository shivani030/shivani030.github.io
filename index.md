I am a recent Junior Research Engineer with the IoT Security Project at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.  Prior to this I was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at [<span style="color: #6495ED">ABES Engineering College, India</span>](https://www.abes.ac.in/), where I taught courses on [<span style="color: #6495ED">Computer System Security </span>](/computer_system_security.md)and [<span style="color: #6495ED">Problem Solving using Python</span>](/problem_solving.md). You can find a detailed list of courses as well as video material [<span style="color: #6495ED	">here</span>](teaching.md).).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Systems Security. I received my Masters in Information Security from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) - Gwalior, India in 2019; where I wrote my dissertation titled, "Detection of Malicious OOXML Documents Using Domain-Specific Features" under the supervision of [<span style="color: #6495ED	">Prof Shashikala Tapaswi</span>](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/index.php/en/component/splms/teacher/Prof.Shashikala).
