My research endeavors lie at the intersection of _Mathematics and Computing,_ delving into captivating realms of _Theory of Computation, Uncertainty Quantification, Fuzzy Set Theory and Rough Set Theory._ I explore the practical applications of these theories in _Data-Dimensionality Reduction, Rule Induction, and Missing Data Imputation_. I am collaborating with [<span style="color: #6495ED">Prof. Srikanta Bedathur </span>](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srikanta/), HOD, SIT, IIT Delhi.

I earned my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from [<span style="color: #6495ED">DST-Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University</span>](https://bhu.ac.in/Site/UnitHomeTemplate/1_233_3536_Main-Site-Centres) under the guidance of [<span style="color: #6495ED">Prof. Tanmoy Som, IIT BHU. </span>](https://iitbhu.irins.org/profile/50246). 


For a comprehensive overview of my academic journey, you can peruse my curriculum vitae available [<span style="color: #6495ED ">here</span>](assets/files/CVShiv2810.pdf).
