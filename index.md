I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at [<span style="color: #6495ED">ABES Engineering College, India</span>](https://www.abes.ac.in/), where I teach courses on [<span style="color: #6495ED">Computer System Security </span>](/computer_system_security.md)and [<span style="color: #6495ED">Problem Solving using Python</span>](/problem_solving).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Systems Security and Machine Learning. Especially, how modern technology can be equipped to target and affect the user. I received my Masters in Information Security from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) - Gwalior, India in 2019; where I wrote my dissertation titled, "Detection of Malicious OOXML Documents Using Domain-Specific Features" under the supervision of [<span style="color: #6495ED	">Prof Shashikala Tapaswi</span>](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/index.php/en/component/splms/teacher/Prof.Shashikala). If you are inclined you can find my complete curriculum vitae [<span style="color: #6495ED	">here</span>](assets/files/PriyanshSingh.pdf).
