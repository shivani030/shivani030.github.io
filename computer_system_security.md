### Introduction

While I was teaching at ABES Engineering College, I was tasked to teach computer security basics to sophomore students in the Bachelor's of Technology domain (essentially a B.E.). The course was conducted as a complement with the online MOOCs course offered by E&ICT Academy, IIT Kanpur. During the classroom hours the students and I discussed the fundamental concepts of Cyber Security and Cyber Defense. The discussions varied from the essential case studies to topical cyber attacks.

### Links

The socratic discussions was supported with reading material, at-home tests and tutorials. The [drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p-kRfqAfQ46Dws_BKa7fPz2DB2-ShIFS?usp=sharing) contains all the material I compiled for the course along with tests that I contributed to.

I hope this helps the people looking for a better understanding of the fundamentals. You may connect with me if you require any help with the material.
