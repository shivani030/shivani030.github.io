During the my tenure as an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department, I had the opportunity to teach over a thousand students. Primarily, I deliver lectures on Security, Problem Solving, and Algorithms.

### [<span style="color: #6495ED">Computer System Security </span>](/computer_system_security.md)

* This subject focuses on the fundamental concepts of Cyber Security and Cyber Defense. The link above contains a brief overview and links to the material.

### [<span style="color: #6495ED">Problem Solving using Python</span>](/problem_solving.md)

* This subject focuses on developing the programming and logical thinking skills of those attempting it. I was part of the team that created this course. More recently, I converted the coursework into a self-learning module which you can find at the link above.

### Basics of Python

* Conducted an online workshop on 'Basics of Python' between 26th March 2021 and 3rd April 2021 for undergraduate students at the Institute of Home Economics, University of Delhi, Delhi.
