When I was younger, I had this feeling of waking up as someone new, a new construct if you will, during most of the university it was after a graduating another year. Until Grey pointed it out on the latest Cortex, I had never linked to significant life changes. The construct of you has died many times and will die at least a few more times.

Just take a minute and think, if you were to meet one of your past constructs, say back from your freshman year, would you get along? Do you think the person reflected in that time portal is the same person as you are today? Or has that construct died you have taken a new form?


Though no longer religious (that construct died somewhere during the tenth to eleventh-grade transition), I have these theological concepts of reincarnation from eight or ten years of classroom studies. If I recall correctly, in Hinduism based on your karmic score at the end of your life, you either get sent to heaven, hell or get reincarnated as an animal or human until the balance sheet settles and you reach nirvana. So why can’t the same analogy be extended to a single life but with different constructs? &nbsp;

If you talk to me IRL or on IM you’ll notice a lot of times I refer back to childhood or to a more juvenile time and if you probe a little further you might notice what I meant was not adolescence, preadolescent or young adult phases but time much closer to few months. I call the past construct from a few months juvenile because it’s true. Six months ago if you had asked me anything about where I would stand right now, most of the predictions would have been wrong. We are continually learning and modifying ourselves to create newer better constructs.

Maybe a better explanation could be taken from the Ship of Theseus thought experiment. Over time your memories fade, you learn more and replace old information. Slowly you have a new core within the same skull.

Think back to those questions, what do you have common with your pre-adolescent self? Yes, you share some basic features but is there a deeper connection? If this 11-year-old you or just a remnant of you, a corpse of a past construct?

We change rapidly and perceive time in different ways, and maybe therein lies the solution to this problem. Given enough presence, these changes can be controlled and steered. As Grey said in his post “Murder yourself to make room for yourself.”

I am grateful to the past me’s, the bygone constructs, the forgotten corpses, for the decisions they made and the time they represent without them this current construct could not exist.

Let’s see how this soul fares. ;)
