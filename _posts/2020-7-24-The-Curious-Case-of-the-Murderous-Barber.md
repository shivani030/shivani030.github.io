I'm currently working on edits to a journal article, and I'm stuck with some indecision. I see my monthly haircut is due, it'll be a refreshing change of pace, and maybe a solution will present itself during this mundane activity as it often does. While I was hoping for a reprieve from my hesitance, something unheard happened during my visit this time. The hairdresser leaned over, said in a very hushed tone, "Don't forget my tip for the festivals".  I quickly think, this was a breach of the social contract we have, but if I say nothing, he might realise the error. A few minute pass, he has a blade right next to my carotid artery, and whispers in my left ear, "Don't forget my tip for the festivals". 

Instead of not focusing on the article, I'm now focusing on how I can slide away from this blade-wielding maniac. I imagine how many times has this guy extorted a customer on knifepoint. What is the probability that the fabric of social conventions crumbles? As the guy politely reminds me a third time, I see the facade of social contract slipping away, as I explore the option of anarchy in this tiny establishment. 

With a bell from the cash register, I'm drawn to the present where the task has been completed. The professional is clearing up the stragglers as I shift in my chair a little.  Maybe I imagined it all, I don't need to change postcodes after all. As I pay my tab and leave, I can sense a smirk from the professional waving me goodbye or is it an invitation to come again?

Hope you, dear reader, are well.
The idea for the above came from a not as exciting encounter last year. The original post was written soon after and portrayed my views on how hairdressers are probably akin to the barkeep from olden days. I explored a few other themes in that post, which upon reflection I no longer subscribe to and hence are omitted from this iteration.
