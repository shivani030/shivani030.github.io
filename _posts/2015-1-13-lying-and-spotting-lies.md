Lying comes as second nature to all of us. All of us are liars. And we often tell lies to slip out of a difficult situation or get into one. Some of us are compulsive liars whatever we say is a lie, and we need to check whether or not we are lying. On the other hand, there are people like me who have a fascination with how people function, display emotions and obviously LIE.

Allison Kornet writes the following in the article&nbsp;“The truth about lying.”
> Leonard Saxe, professor of psychology at Brandeis University, points out that most of us receive conflicting messages about lying. Although we're socialized from the time we can speak to believe that it's always better, to tell the truth, in reality, society often encourages and even rewards deception. Show up late for an early morning meeting at work and its best not to admit that you overslept. "You're punished far more than you would be if you lie and say you were stuck in traffic," Saxe notes. Moreover, lying is integral to many occupations. Think about how often we see lawyers constructing far-fetched theories on behalf of their clients or reporters misrepresenting themselves in order to gain access to good stories.

Let’s get something’s straight about lying:

1.  Lying is a Co-operative process: Both the person who is deceiving and the person who is being deceived are equally responsible for the outcome of the situation.
2.  Not all Lies are harmful: Some lies like meaningless pleasantries “I’m Fine” or “No trouble at all” are not harmful. A real lie tries to mislead, and convey a tautologically false impression.
3.  We are against lying but we are covertly for it: It is part of our culture. It has been woven into our culture over centuries. It comes as easy as breathing to us. Think Dante, Shakespeare, News, Mahabharat.[[MORE]]

Studies show on a given day you may be lied to between 10 to 200 times. Strangers lie three times within the 10 minutes of meeting each other. We start at an early age, and we never stop. We have created for ourselves a world full of spam, fake digital friends, ingenious identity thieves, and world-class Ponzi schemers. It has become impossible to navigate through this cluttered world. So how do you do it?

**“Everyone is willing to give you something for whatever they are hungry for. And if you don’t want to be deceived, you need to know what it is that you are hungry for” ~ Henry Oberlander**

**LIE SPOTING** 

Paul Ekman is an American psychologist who is best known as “the best human lie detector in the world.” He is a pioneer in the study of emotions and has created the fundamentals for lie detection. He created an ‘atlas of emotions.’

1.  **Verbal Dodging:** A person who maybe over-determined in their denial will resort to formal than informal language. They also use distancing language like “That Person,” trying to distance themselves from their subject. Also sometimes they use qualifying language or spicing up with details, hoping to force their lie over the subject. If you suspect someone is lying or making up a story, just ask them to repeat the sequence of statements in reverse order. A person telling the truth will have no problem recounting the details whereas a person who is lying has to put to remember.

2.  ** Body Language:** If someone is quiet and not providing any verbal cues then they start giving some non-verbal cues. Liars are known to freeze their upper body while lying. They tend to look you in the eyes a little too much to compensate for the myth that liars do not. Our body slips up whenever we are lying consciously. Some people say no while they are nodding yes. People leak a shoulder shrug, or maybe a masking smile also called as “Duping Delight.” It is a smile that one slips up when he or she has gotten away with the lie. Sometimes they might be giving you the finger while showing that they are cleaning their eye. More often these slips or leaks happen when people try to hide a feeling, and they crack through, these are technically known as micro-expressions. Murderers are known to show a glimpse of sadness. There are thousands of these signs, and alone they mean nothing. It is the cluster that makes it the fact that the other person is lying. The proposed Facial Action Coding System recognises the presence of micro-expressions in real time as they appear as human and classifies them as necessary. It divides the face and facial muscles into Action Units and Action descriptors which can later be decoded to see the meaning.

**"When you combine the science of reorganising deception with the art of looking, listening to you except yourself from collaborating in a lie.” ~ Pamela Meyer**
